# halo_lensing

A handy python code to compute weak lensing properties of NFW and Hernquist density profiles as well as the 2-halo term. The code includes the Fourier tranforms of those profiles to enable fast calculations of the mis-centering effect. It uses [colossus package](https://bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus), which you need to install by pip, for calculation of distances and the linear matter power spectrum as well as a [FFTLog code](https://github.com/xfangcosmo/FFTLog-and-beyond), which is included here.
